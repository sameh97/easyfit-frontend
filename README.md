Temporary link to product catalog:

This is a feature that gives a gym manager the ability to create a link that will be available until the date he wants for example three days.

this link will actually display products he selected when creating the link within a catalog, and send this link to his customers so they can see what he posted.
this helps the gym manager to Advertise his products.

(the link will be available to everyone online, there is no need to register on the site)

Here is all the Temporary links for a specific user (Gym manager) displayed in a table:

Home page:

This page contains two charts, one chart showing how many new members have joined by month, and the second chart showing how many male members there are compared to the female members.

this gives the gym manager the ability to see his business data and track it more effectively.
